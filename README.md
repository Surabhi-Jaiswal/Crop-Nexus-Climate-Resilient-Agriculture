# Crop Nexus: Climate-Resilient Agriculture

## Project Overview
Crop Nexus is a comprehensive solution for predicting crop yields under various climate scenarios, aiding farmers and policymakers in optimizing agricultural practices for resilience and sustainability. This project is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals: Zero Hunger, Climate Action, and Life on Land.

We developed a machine learning model to forecast crop yields using climate data, integrated with a Tkinter-based user interface, and created impactful visualizations in Python and Power BI to present actionable insights.

## Project Contents
- Dataset: Agricultural Crop Yield in Indian States Dataset (1997-2020)
- Machine Learning Model: Developed using Python (Scikit-learn)
- User Interface: Built with Tkinter for enhanced usability
- Visualizations: Advanced charts and 3D plots in Python and Power BI


## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure the dataset is in the correct directory before running the model notebook.
2. Use `Crop_Model.ipynb` to train the machine learning model on crop yield data.
3. Use `Visualization_UI.ipynb` to generate visualizations and interact with the Tkinter-based UI for predictions.
4. Check `PowerBI_Report.pdf` for additional insights on visualizations created with Power BI.

## Key Features
- Predictive Modeling: Forecasts crop yields under various climate conditions.
- Interactive UI: Tkinter-based interface for ease of use.
- Data Visualization: 3D plots and Power BI dashboards.
- Alignment with SDGs: Focus on global agricultural challenges.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Tkinter
- Power BI: Interactive reports and dashboards
- Machine Learning: Regression models for yield prediction
- Real-world climate data: Agricultural statistics from 1997-2020
